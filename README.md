# AI for Safe Transportation Use Case - Smart Cities
## Transportation is a critical sector to any country given it acts as the  vessel for all other activities including individuals, enterprises, governmental and commercial services. Key drainers of transportation systems are accidents and critical incidents which either affect safety or caused by unsafe driving patterns. For example, a traffic accident on a high way could result in chain of accidents which happened quite frequently over past years. Unresponsible driving attitude resulted in severe accidents and sudden utilities incidents like broken pipeline can cause even more damage if not concealed in timely fashion. The mobilization of action force teams to handle such incidents is also key attribute in mitigating the associated risks.

## The aim of this use case is utilizing AI methods and techniques can function computer vision, statistical analysis and optimization to anticipate, spot and act on such incidents prospectively including suggesting best ways to handle. On current direction adopting intelligent transportation systems nation-wide, such solution can leverage collected data from cameras, sensors and official information systems to provide capabilities to involved governmental and community sectors to act faster and more accurate. Such enhanced performance on a key sector like transportation works as cornerstone for the digital cities by enabling better planning and implementation of related services. Using Spatial AI as part of the solution can overcome the difficulties associated with transportation networks being operating on very large-scale geographies.
